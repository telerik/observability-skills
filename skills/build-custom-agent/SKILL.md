name: build-custom-agent
description: Build a bounded .NET 10 local agent prototype from a short Purpose. For requests requiring live access, real effects, or complex orchestration, offer an integration plan and, when meaningful, a separately confirmed simplified mock PoC. Use for the custom-agent path, not a ready template or an existing app.

# Build a custom agent

This workflow produces either a safe local prototype or a zero-write integration
plan in chat. It never implements live business-system access or real effects.
`Try-and-refine: on|off` is an optional workflow preference, not Purpose; retain
the latest explicit value across revisions and path changes without asking for it.
When unspecified, offer it only after the local prototype is ready.

When Purpose is present, read `references/scope-routing.md` without a scenario
summary. For a complex path choice, go directly to the question tool: its body
contains the scope explanation. Do not duplicate that explanation in commentary.

## Intake and approval

1. If Purpose is absent, ask exactly:

   > In 1-2 short sentences, what should this agent help someone accomplish?

2. Apply the routing reference. Infer a bounded Name, Knowledge, and no more
   than three Actions. Ask at most its one permitted ambiguity clarification;
   never ask for credentials or secret values.

3. A buildable request gets a compact **Proposed local prototype** containing
   Purpose, Name, Knowledge, and Actions. Say which sources are user-supplied
   and which are mock, and that no live adapter will be used. Nothing is built
   yet. A complex/live request instead gets only the reference's scope-first
   question; do not show a plan preview or four-field block.

   Use exactly the applicable two choices:

   | Situation | Choices |
   |---|---|
   | Local proposal | `Build proposed agent` / `Revise proposed agent` |
   | Complex request with a useful bounded mock slice | `Show implementation plan` / `Propose a simplified mock PoC` |
   | Complex request without an eligible mock slice | `Show implementation plan` / `Revise proposed agent` |

   Use the host's question tool when available. For a local proposal, ask
   `How would you like to continue?` with exactly the Build/Revise labels. For
   a complex request, put the scope explanation and that question together in
   the tool's question body, with the applicable structured choices. If no
   question tool exists, present the same context and two numbered choices.
   Wait for the user's answer. Cancellation, empty input, or tool failure
   selects nothing.

   An explicit implementation-plan request selects the plan directly. Declining
   mocks does not; keep plan/revise unless the user asks for the plan.

4. Interpret a returned selection only as follows:

   - `Propose a simplified mock PoC`: show the reduced four fields plus excluded
     behavior, then ask Build/Revise and wait. Preserve the full goal for
     `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`; do not restart intake or create files.
   - `Build proposed agent`: approve only the latest displayed local scope.
     Begin without more customization questions; prerequisites may still stop it.
   - `Show implementation plan`: follow the zero-write plan section.
   - `Revise proposed agent`: use the reference's one-reply revision, reroute,
     and ask the appropriate next choice.

No project writes occur before explicit Build approval. Use an interactive
session for the guided flow. In noninteractive mode, return the proposal and
end the turn unless the conversation already contains explicit approval of
that exact displayed scope. Tool execution permissions do not approve a
proposed scope.

## Build the local prototype

Use the requested target or infer a lowercase-hyphen folder. Require .NET 10,
locate this skill, and run:

```bash
dotnet run --file <skill-directory>/scripts/copy-template.cs -- --target <target>
```

Accept only a missing target or a real empty directory. Never bypass a refusal,
overwrite content, reconstruct the starter, or source/copy a parent `.env`.

Edits are limited to:

- `AgentDefinition.cs`: its bounded definition and one-to-three registrations;
- `Tools.cs`: at most three deterministic local or clearly mock tools;
- regular `.md`/`.txt` files under `docs/` and `.json`/`.csv` under `data/`;
- `appsettings.json`: `Content:Sources`, `Agent`, and the three fixed `Smoke`
  cases. `Content:Sources` must map every content path exactly once to `mock` or
  `supplied`; use `supplied` only for files the user provided;
- `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, required only for an external-source prototype or
  simplified mock PoC.

Choose UI preset `knowledge` for Q&A, `review` for evidence checking,
`workflow` for triage/process work, or `analysis` for summaries/metrics. Keep
the input hint short and scenario-specific. Instructions must preserve concise
plain text, exact source/section citations, provenance, qualifications, and
honest missing evidence. Keep conditional rules within their source's scope;
a requirement for one case must not become a requirement for all cases.
Every literal `docs/` or `data/` reference must resolve.

All other files are fixed, including runtime and standard SDK instrumentation,
HTTP/UI/health, project/packages, and smoke engine. Add no dependencies. Generate
no external calls, process execution, file writes, secret reads, live effects,
or background control loops. Do not use an installed adapter, connector, or MCP
tool during intake, build, or smoke. Azure OpenAI and Progress runtime settings
remain as documented user-secrets. The validator checks project structure,
configuration, declared content, and smoke expectations; it does not analyze
editable C# or establish its safety.

Preserve the fixed tracing setup: Progress exports agent/chat `UseOpenTelemetry`
spans, and `FunctionInvokingChatClient` supplies tool spans under the agent.
Tool-only responses may have empty Output text; their structured calls are
recorded by the SDK. Add no separate tool wrapper.
`Progress:Observability:RecordInputs` and `Progress:Observability:RecordOutputs`
default to `true`. Setting either flag to `false` disables both directions of
agent/chat/tool content; use the README's process-specific overrides when
requested. SDK exception text remains outside these switches.

For mock PoCs, keep the reduced scope and mock limitation visible in Purpose,
instructions, answers, and handoff. `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` contains only the
separate developer continuation; never execute it during this build.

## Required gates

Before building, review `AgentDefinition.cs` and `Tools.cs`: confirm the accepted
local/mock scope, one to three local functions, and that literal `docs/` and
`data/` paths resolve. Check for external calls, process execution, file writes,
secret access, live effects, or background loops and remove any that were added.
Do not treat a validator pass as a substitute for this review.

Validate before building. Once that passes, copy the current
`appsettings.json` to a temporary `smoke-baseline.json` outside the project,
before the first smoke. Never replace it. Every later validation, including
after repair, uses that snapshot; a genuine expectation redesign makes the
build unverified rather than authorizing a weaker baseline.

```bash
dotnet run --file <skill-directory>/scripts/validate-project.cs -- --target <target>
# Save the validated appsettings.json outside the project now.
dotnet build <target>/CustomAgent.csproj
dotnet run --project <target>/CustomAgent.csproj -- --smoke
```

Require one `SMOKE_REPORT=<json>` with overall `pass` and exactly the passing
IDs `knowledge`, `tool`, `not-found`. Prompts are ordinary questions; expected
markers remain separate and use stable facts/source paths, not internal
diagnostic tokens. Preserve trace IDs as local execution evidence. Smokes do
not prove reasoning quality, actual tool invocation, ingestion, live outcomes,
or production safety. On missing configuration, name only the missing keys and
refer to the README; never inspect or print values.

Resolve the copied project directory to `<absolute-target>`. Start the built app
persistently on an OS-assigned loopback port using that absolute path, regardless
of the current working directory:

```bash
dotnet run --project "<absolute-target>/CustomAgent.csproj" --no-build -- --urls http://127.0.0.1:0
```

Use the host's persistent terminal or background-process mechanism with readable
stdout and stderr. Once launched, immediately read that process's output in the
same turn unless the URL is already present. Use short bounded reads for at most
30 seconds total and stop if the process exits. Do not wait for the server
command to complete, because a healthy server remains running, and do not end
the turn with a passive "Waiting..." status. If process output is not directly
readable, use one combined launch log beside the requested target, never a
shared `/tmp` filename. Disclose if the process cannot outlive the session.

Read only this process's own
`Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:<port>` line and health-check that exact
process at `<url>/api/health`. Never guess or scan ports. A process exit,
missing listen line at the deadline, or failed health is a failed gate. Never
start a replacement because an output read was incomplete, and never restart
an already healthy process. Finally validate again:

```bash
dotnet run --file <skill-directory>/scripts/validate-project.cs -- --target <target> --smoke-baseline <snapshot>
```

## Optional try and refine

After all required gates pass, verify `/` and `/api/health` at the running app's
URL. Show a brief readiness summary with the project path, clickable UI link
and three passing smoke results before considering this optional phase.

- Explicit `Try-and-refine: on`: run once without asking again.
- Explicit `Try-and-refine: off`: proceed to handoff with
  `Behavior check: skipped (off)`.
- No preference: reuse the working question-tool format from Build/Revise with
  `Finish here` and `Run try-and-refine`. Put the readiness summary (project
  path, clickable UI link and three passing smoke results) and this question
  together in the tool's question body:

  > Would you like me to try four additional scenarios and make one small fix
  > if needed? This makes extra model calls and may take several minutes.

  Without a question tool, present the same context and two choices in chat.
  Keep the app running while awaiting the answer. Only `Run try-and-refine` or an equivalent
  explicit request approves execution. `Finish here`, cancellation, empty input
  or a failed question tool proceeds to handoff with
  `Behavior check: not run (no opt-in)`; never infer approval or ask repeatedly.
  In noninteractive mode, finish without this question or phase unless already
  explicitly requested.

Only after opt-in, read and follow
[the behavior-check procedure](references/try-and-refine.md); prepare its
scenarios and start its time budget then. If unavailable, report it skipped
without reconstructing it. Plan-only requests and failed required gates never
reach this offer. This preference is not a generated setting, and declining it
does not invalidate a successful basic build.

## Handoff

After all checks, including optional behavior checks, leave the app running
in the persistent session. If it was stopped, relaunch using the
persistent-start procedure above. Immediately before the final response, verify
both `/` and `/api/health` at its current URL, then include a clickable UI link.
Do not stop the app as test cleanup or substitute a launch command for a live link.

Report success only after copy, both validations, build, all smokes, and health.
Include the absolute project path, verified UI URL, three smoke results with
their emitted trace IDs, and exactly one link:
`https://observability.progress.com/observations`. Do not make
per-trace links; state that backend trace ingestion is not independently
verified. For external/mock prototypes, name mock and supplied sources, confirm
no live adapter was used, link `INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`, and distinguish tested
sample decisions from unvalidated production behavior.

Append this note verbatim to the successful local-prototype handoff:

> **Development use only:** This agent is in a local development environment. .NET user-secrets stores credentials unencrypted in a JSON file in your user profile. For production deployment, inject credentials through environment variables backed by your deployment’s secret manager.
> If you used user-secrets or entered credentials directly in terminal commands, I can guide you through removing the saved development credentials and relevant shell-history entries when you finish testing.

Keep the cleanup offer conditional: a successful run does not establish that
user-secrets were used. Do not inspect secret-store contents or shell history
to decide. Perform cleanup only when requested, after testing; explain that
`Progress.AgentBuilder.Mvp` is shared across all five agents before removing
settings. Refer to the copied README for targeted removal and shell-specific
guidance; do not automatically clear the store or unrelated shell history.

## Integration plan only

After `Show implementation plan`, create no files and run no copier, build,
smoke, app, trace, credential, or external-system commands. Return a concise
chat plan covering MAF shape, adapters, authentication/permissions, data
contracts, effect controls, failures, tests, deployment, observability, and
developer ownership. Preserve requested automation; label safer alternatives
as changed assumptions rather than implying acceptance.
