# Build a ready agent template

Copy the selected finished asset without generating or customizing source.
This workflow writes one new project folder.

Use the bundled `templates.json` in this skill directory for the exact IDs,
project filenames, and three smoke-case IDs. A platform handoff supplies the
selected template ID:

| ID | Data and experience |
|---|---|
| `release-evidence-reviewer` | Markdown release evidence; contextual review chat and New review |
| `docs-qa` | Markdown Q&A; source-scoped questions and follow-ups (local lexical RAG) |
| `operations-data-analyst` | Mock CSV; ask questions, inspect KPIs, and change the dashboard view |
| `ticket-triage` | JSON inbox and Markdown policy; questions and temporary intake scenarios |

Honor the requested ID or unambiguous display name. An explicitly unknown
template is an error, not a request to invent one. If no template is specified,
preserve the `release-evidence-reviewer` default. The default target is `./<id>`.
Do not ask domain/design questions or route to the custom builder.

## Workflow

1. Require the .NET 10 SDK. Locate this skill's own directory and read the
   selected catalog entry. Run its package-free .NET file-based helper:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --file <skill-directory>/scripts/copy-template.cs -- --template <id> --target <target>
   ```

   The copier accepts only a missing target or a real empty directory. It must
   succeed before continuing. Do not work around a refusal, overwrite content,
   or reconstruct the asset from memory. This customer workflow does not
   require Python. `--list` prints the catalog without creating a project.

2. Resolve the copied project directory to an absolute path (`<absolute-target>`).
   Run `dotnet build "<absolute-target>/<catalog-project>"`. Do not modify the
   copied source to make the build pass; report an asset defect if the unchanged
   template fails.

3. Never source or copy a parent `.env`. The app reads local settings from .NET
   user-secrets as documented in the copied README. Run all three local cases
   with `dotnet run --project "<absolute-target>/<catalog-project>" -- --smoke`.
   Parse the single-line `SMOKE_REPORT=<json>` marker and require overall `pass` plus exactly the
   three passing case IDs from the selected catalog entry. Do not accept
   skipped tests, another template's cases, or a report from an earlier run.

   Preserve each exact trace ID emitted by the runner. Azure OpenAI settings
   (`AzureOpenAI:Endpoint`, `AzureOpenAI:Deployment`, and the optional
   `AzureOpenAI:ApiKey` when local Azure identity is not used) and
   `Progress:Observability:ApiKey` (an **Integration** credential) are app
   inputs. If configuration is missing, name only the missing keys and point to
   the copied README's user-secrets commands; never request, inspect, or print
   credential values. Let the app report missing configuration: do not run
   `dotnet user-secrets list`, read secret-store files, or dump the environment
   as a prerequisite check.
   Mock data describes bundled business fixtures, not a mock model: smoke cases
   and UI actions call configured Azure OpenAI. A successful run used available
   app configuration; never infer that credentials or model access are unnecessary.

   Preserve the bundled tracing setup: Progress exports agent/chat
   `UseOpenTelemetry` spans, with tool executions under their agent invocation.
   Tool-only responses may have empty Output text; their structured calls are
   recorded by the SDK.
   `Progress:Observability:RecordInputs` and `Progress:Observability:RecordOutputs`
   default to `true`. Setting either flag to `false` disables both directions
   of agent/chat/tool content; use the README's process-specific overrides when
   requested. SDK exception text remains outside these switches.

4. Start the already-built web app on an OS-assigned loopback port. Use the
   same absolute target so this command works from any working directory:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project "<absolute-target>/<catalog-project>" --no-build -- --urls http://127.0.0.1:0
   ```

   Keep that process running and actively read its own standard
   `Now listening on: http://127.0.0.1:<port>` line. Use the host's persistent
   terminal or background-process mechanism with readable stdout and stderr.
   Once launched, immediately read that process's output in the same turn
   unless the URL is already present. Use short bounded reads for at most 30
   seconds total and stop if the process exits. Do not wait for the server
   command to complete, because a healthy server remains running, and do not
   end the turn with a passive "Waiting..." status. If process output is not
   directly readable, use one combined launch log beside the requested target,
   never a shared `/tmp` filename. Disclose if the process cannot outlive the
   session.

   Verify `/api/health` only at the exact reported URL. Never guess, scan, or
   reuse a default or nearby port. A process exit or missing listening line at
   the deadline fails the health gate. Never start a replacement because an
   output read was incomplete, and never restart an already healthy process.
   Require HTTP 200 with `status=ready` from `/api/health` and HTTP 200 from `/`;
   a degraded health response is not a pass. Read HTTP results directly without
   creating health-check files (for example, `curl --fail --silent --show-error
   <actual-url>/api/health`). If browser tools are available,
   also exercise the selected page's main action and inspect its result/error
   state. Never claim a browser interaction was checked when only HTTP was used.

5. Return exactly one Progress Observability **Tracing page** link:
   `https://observability.progress.com/observations`. Do not resolve, construct,
   or list per-trace deep links.

Report success only after copy, build, all three smoke cases, and UI health pass.
Return the absolute project path, verified local UI link, one Progress
Observability Tracing page link, and the three smoke-case results with their
emitted trace IDs. Those IDs are local execution evidence; this workflow does
not verify backend ingestion. State explicitly that backend trace ingestion is
not independently verified by this workflow. On a failure, report the failed
gate and the smallest safe retry; do not claim the template is ready.

Append this note verbatim to the successful handoff:

> **Development use only:** This agent is in a local development environment. .NET user-secrets stores credentials unencrypted in a JSON file in your user profile. For production deployment, inject credentials through environment variables backed by your deployment’s secret manager.
> If you used user-secrets or entered credentials directly in terminal commands, I can guide you through removing the saved development credentials and relevant shell-history entries when you finish testing.

Keep the cleanup offer conditional: a successful run does not establish that
user-secrets were used. Do not inspect secret-store contents or shell history
to decide. Perform cleanup only when requested, after testing; explain that
`Progress.AgentBuilder.Mvp` is shared across all five agents before removing
settings. Refer to the copied README for targeted removal and shell-specific
guidance; do not automatically clear the store or unrelated shell history.
